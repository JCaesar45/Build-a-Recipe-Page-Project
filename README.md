# Creamy Chocolate Fudge Recipe Webpage

This project is a simple, static HTML webpage that showcases a single recipe for Creamy Chocolate Fudge. It serves as a basic example of how to structure a recipe page with various HTML elements, including headings, images, lists, and links.

## Features

- Proper HTML5 structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- Includes `<head>` with a `<title>`.
- Contains an `<h1>` for the recipe name.
- Displays an image with an appropriate `alt` attribute.
- Describes the recipe with headings and paragraphs.
- Lists ingredients using an unordered list (`<ul>`).
- Details preparation steps with an ordered list (`<ol>`).
- Provides links to other recipes under "More Recipes" section.

## How to Use

1. Save the provided code as `index.html`.
2. Replace the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag with the path to your recipe image.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the webpage.

## Customization Tips

- Add more recipes to the "More Recipes" list by copying and modifying `<li><a href="#">...</a></li>`.
- Style the page with CSS for better appearance.
- Link to actual recipe pages instead of `#`.
